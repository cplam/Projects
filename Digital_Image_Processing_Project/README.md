# Digital Imaging Processing for beauty
## Project Overview
This project implements an image segmentation pipeline for skin regions. The main methods include:
- Skin-threshold segmentation in the YCbCr color space
- Otsu global thresholding
- Morphological operations (closing and opening) for mask refinement

The program processes input images one by one and outputs intermediate and final segmentation results for analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
This repository does not include the `dataset` files. Please download them separately.
